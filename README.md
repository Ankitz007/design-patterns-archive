# Design Patterns Archive

This repository contains flash cards for various design patterns, including the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns and other common design patterns. The flashcards are designed to help you learn and understand these patterns through a question-and-answer format.

## Contents

So far, the following design patterns have been included:

- **Behavioral Patterns:** Design patterns that are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
  - [State](behavioral/state/README.md): A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
  - [Strategy](behavioral/strategy/README.md): A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.
  - [Observer](behavioral/observer/README.md): A behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
  - [Command](behavioral/command/README.md): A behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request.

- **Structural Patterns:** Design patterns that deal with object composition or structure.
  - [Facade](structural/facade/README.md): A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
